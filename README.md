# PupOS üê∂

üöß This repo is under construction üöß

PupOS is a furry Linux distro built on [Fedora
Atomic](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/).

## ISO

To build a PupOS ISO, you'll need to [install
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run this command to install
the BlueBuild CLI:

```bash
cargo install --locked blue-build
```

Then you can run this command to build the ISO:

```bash
sudo bluebuild generate-iso --iso-name pup-os.iso image ghcr.io/justlark/pup-os
```

## Installation

To rebase an existing Fedora Atomic installation to the latest build:

First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies
installed:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/justlark/pup-os:latest
```

Reboot to complete the rebase:

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

Then rebase to the signed image, like so:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/justlark/pup-os:latest
```

Reboot again to complete the installation

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

## Verification

PupOS images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by
downloading the [cosign.pub](./cosign.pub) file from this repo and running the
following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/justlark/pup-os
```
